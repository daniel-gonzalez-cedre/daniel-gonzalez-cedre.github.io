intro,"I am a second year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame. I'm advised by [Tim Weninger](https://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge/).

My research is currently focused on modeling the temporal behaviour and evolution of graphs. In particular, I'm interested in interpretable and grammar-based approaches to modeling. More broadly, I'm interested in ecology and applications of linear algebra and stochastic analysis.

For advanced fun, I like to boulder and play music."
